  <h2>Basic Info</h2>
  
  <p> The blue big Yoshi is a Baby Yoshi that is only found in the Star World, where they hatch from eggs of the same colour whenver Mario makes his approach. If you feed the Baby Yoshies - such as enemies, shells, coins, or active grab blocks, it will turn the yoshi into an adult Yoshi</p>
