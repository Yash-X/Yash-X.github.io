    <p> Smiling is infectious,<br>
You catch it like the flu,<br>
When someone smiled at me today,<br>
I started smiling too.<br>
<br>
I passed around the corner,<br>
And someone saw my grin,<br>
When he smiled I realized,<br>
I'd passed it on to him.<br>
<br>
I thought about that smile,<br>
Then realized its worth,<br>
A single smile, just like mine,<br>
Could travel round the earth.<br>
<br>
So, if you feel a smile begin,<br>
Don't leave it undetected.<br>
Let's start an epidemic quick,<br>
And get the world infected. </p>
